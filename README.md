## Analytics Reporter

*This project is still under construction.*

# Note: This repo is deployed automatically to Heroku. Push only working code to master!

A lightweight system for publishing analytics data from Google Analytics profiles.

Available reports are named and described in [`reports.json`](reports.json). For now, they're hardcoded into the repository.

### Installing

* Install through npm:

```bash
npm install -g analytics-reporter
```

* [Create an API service account](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount) in the Google developer dashboard.

* Take the generated client email address (ends with `gserviceaccount.com`) and grant it `Read & Analyze` permissions to the Google Analytics profile(s) whose data you wish to publish.

* Download the `.p12` private key file from the dashboard, and transform it into a `.pem` file:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in <name of your p12 key>.p12 -out secret_key.pem -nocerts -nodes
```

* Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export ANALYTICS_REPORT_EMAIL="asdfghjkl@developer.gserviceaccount.com"
export ANALYTICS_REPORT_IDS="ga:XXXXXX"
export ANALYTICS_KEY_PATH="/path/to/secret_key.pem"
```
You may wish to manage these using [`autoenv`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv).

* Test your configuration by printing a report to STDOUT:

```bash
./bin/report users
```

If you see a nicely formatted JSON file, you are all set.

* (Optional) Authorize yourself for S3 publishing.

If you plan to use this project's lightweight S3 publishing system, you'll need to add 6 more environment variables:

```
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[your-key]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[your-secret-key]

export AWS_BUCKET=[your-bucket]
export AWS_BUCKET_PATH=[your-path]
export AWS_CACHE_TIME=0
```

### Use

Reports are created and published using the `analytics` command.

```bash
analytics
```

This will run every report, in sequence, and print out the resulting JSON to STDOUT. There will be two newlines between each report.

A report might look something like this:

```javascript
{
  "name": "devices",
  "query": {
    "dimensions": [
      "ga:date",
      "ga:deviceCategory"
    ],
    "metrics": [
      "ga:sessions"
    ],
    "start-date": "90daysAgo",
    "end-date": "yesterday",
    "sort": "ga:date"
  },
  "meta": {
    "name": "Devices",
    "description": "Weekly desktop/mobile/tablet visits by day for all .gov sites tracked by the U.S. federal government's Digital Analytics Program."
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "date": "2014-10-14",
      "device": "desktop",
      "visits": "11495462"
    },
    {
      "date": "2014-10-14",
      "device": "mobile",
      "visits": "2499586"
    },
    {
      "date": "2014-10-14",
      "device": "tablet",
      "visits": "976396"
    },
    // ...
  ],
  "totals": {
    "devices": {
      "mobile": 213920363,
      "desktop": 755511646,
      "tablet": 81874189
    },
    "start_date": "2014-10-14",
    "end_date": "2015-01-11"
  }
}
```

#### Options

* `--output` - Output to a directory.
